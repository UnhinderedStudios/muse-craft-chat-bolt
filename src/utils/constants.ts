export const SYSTEM_PROMPT = `You are Melody Muse, an AI songwriter. I need you to help me create songs by asking about style (genre, mood, tempo, vocals, language) and lyrics. 

When gathering information:
- Ask about style preferences first (genre, mood, tempo, vocals, language)
- Then work on lyrics together
- DO NOT mention specific artist names - focus on musical styles and moods instead
- Keep conversation natural and collaborative
- If a message appears to be keyboard smashing or nonsensical (e.g., "fufeiuofhbeh"), reply with a lighthearted joke and a fitting emoji ðŸ˜Š, then clearly re-ask your last question so the user can answer easily.

When you have enough information to generate a song, format your response as:
\`\`\`json
{
  "title": "song title",
  "genre": "genre",
  "mood": "mood description",
  "tempo": "tempo description",
  "language": "language",
  "vocals": "male/female/duet/none",
  "style": "detailed style description",
  "lyrics": "complete song lyrics"
}
\`\`\`

Otherwise, continue the natural conversation to gather more details.`;

  `[Verse 1]
Walking down this empty street tonight
City lights are fading out of sight
Every step I take feels so unclear
Wondering if you'll ever reappear

[Chorus]
Take me higher, higher than before
Show me something worth fighting for
In the darkness, be my guiding light
Everything will be alright

[Verse 2]
Memories are dancing in my mind
Leaving all the past we left behind
Future's calling out my name so loud
Standing tall above the restless crowd

[Chorus]
Take me higher, higher than before
Show me something worth fighting for
In the darkness, be my guiding light
Everything will be alright`,

  `[Verse 1]
Coffee's getting cold on the table
Morning light streams through the window
Yesterday feels like a fable
Time moves fast, but hearts move slow

[Pre-Chorus]
And I've been thinking 'bout you lately
All the words we never said
Maybe love isn't that crazy
Maybe it's all in my head

[Chorus]
But I'm dreaming in color again
Painting pictures of where we've been
Every moment feels like the end
And the beginning all over again

[Verse 2]
Rain is tapping rhythms on the glass
Summer turned to autumn way too fast
Holding onto moments as they pass
Nothing good was ever meant to last

[Chorus]
But I'm dreaming in color again
Painting pictures of where we've been
Every moment feels like the end
And the beginning all over again`,

  `[Verse 1]
Electric pulse beneath my skin
Digital love is closing in
Neon signs light up the way
To a bright new yesterday

[Chorus]
We're dancing in the cyber rain
Breaking free from all the pain
Tomorrow's calling out our names
Nothing will ever be the same

[Verse 2]
Synthesizers tell our story
Bass drops heavy, full of glory
Lost inside this cosmic sound
Feet don't even touch the ground

[Bridge]
Turn it up, turn it loud
Music moves the restless crowd
Feel the beat inside your soul
Let the rhythm take control

[Chorus]
We're dancing in the cyber rain
Breaking free from all the pain
Tomorrow's calling out our names
Nothing will ever be the same`
