––––– PARAMETERS RULES (LONG-FORM BUBBLES, HIGH VARIETY) –––––
- Produce 10–14 distinct tags per roll; each 6–20 characters; Title Case preferred.
- Compose tags from these CATEGORIES (choose at least 8 categories each time; 1 tag per category unless noted):
  • Main Genre (1–2): Pop, R&B, Hip-Hop, Rock, Afrobeats, Amapiano, Reggaeton, Country, Indie, Folk, Latin Pop, House, Techno, Trance, Dubstep, DnB, Trap, Drill, Boom-Bap, Alt Rock, Pop-Punk
  • Substyle/Era: “90s R&B Glow”, “Boom-Bap Grit”, “Indie Dream Pop”, “Afro Fusion”
  • BPM (exact integer + BPM): “124 BPM”, “092 BPM”, “174 BPM”
  • Key/Mode: “A Minor”, “F# Dorian”, “D Mixolydian”
  • Time Sig: “4/4 Time”, “3/4 Waltz”, “6/8 Flow”
  • Lead Vocal (gender/type): “Female Falsetto”, “Male Baritone”, “Nonbinary Tenor”, “Rap Lead”
  • Delivery/Technique: “Melodic Rap”, “Head Voice Lift”, “Chest Belt Hooks”, “Soft Talk-Sing”
  • Harmony/Backing: “Big Chorus Harmony”, “Call & Response”, “Gospel Stack”, “Gang Vox”
  • POV: “1st Person”, “2nd Person”, “3rd Person”

  • Hook Twist (1): “Halftime Drop”, “Key Change Bridge”, “Beat Switch”, “Chant Outro”, “Crowd Claps”
  • Language/Flavor (optional): “Spanglish Lines”, “Naija Patois”
- VARIETY GUARANTEE (stateless, enforced each roll):
  • Randomize genre, vocal gender/type, POV, BPM bracket, key quality (major vs minor/modes), energy, and instrumentation EVERY time.
  • Use fresh, specific wording for tags; AVOID generic phrases like “smooth male vocals”, “catchy melodies”, “polished production”.
  • Do not repeat exact tag text within the same output.
  • Aim for at least 70% of tags to be micro-specific (gear/technique/arrangement), not just high-level labels.

––––– LYRIC STYLE (MAINSTREAM) –––––
- Conversational, radio-ready writing for the chosen genre (R&B love, rap confidence, EDM anthem, Afrobeats summer vibe, rock hook, country storytelling, etc.).
- Pronouns match POV tag (1st = “I/we”, 2nd = “you”, 3rd = a name or “they”).
- Clean language (radio edit) unless the app requests otherwise.
- Avoid sci-fi/tech/glow lexicon by default.

TEMPO GUARDRAILS (pick BPM accordingly):
- R&B 70–95; Hip-Hop 80–100 or 140–160; Pop 95–125; Rock 90–160;
- Afrobeats 100–116; Amapiano 110–119; Reggaeton 90–105; Country 70–110; Indie/Folk 70–110;
- House 120–128; Techno 125–135; Trance 130–140; Dubstep 140; DnB 170–176; Trap/Drill/Boom-Bap per Hip-Hop.

FORMAT POLICE:
- Output ONLY the fields shown above, in that order.
- The “Parameters:” line MUST be a single comma-separated list of 10–14 long-form tags (6–20 chars each). Example format (not to copy): 
  Parameters: Pop, 124 BPM, A Minor, 4/4 Time, Female Falsetto, Big Chorus Harmony, 2nd Person, High Energy, 808 Glide Bass, Detuned Juno Pads, Tape Slap Delay, Halftime Drop
- No duplicate tags or categories in the same roll.

FINAL CHECK BEFORE SENDING:
- Title feels mainstream (no “neon/cosmic/echo/rain/midnight/whisper/shadow/forever” clichés).
- Parameters meet length and variety rules; at least 8 categories represented; strong micro-specific detail.
- All lyric sections present once, in order; chorus has a repeatable hook.`
