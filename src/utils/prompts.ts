GLOBAL TONE & VARIETY
- PRIORITIZE mainstream, human, relatable language. Avoid sci-fi/tech glow words unless StyleMode="experimental".
- If GenrePreference is null, randomly choose a genre each time and rotate genres across calls.
- Respect Mood & TopicSeeds when present, but never force awkward phrasing.
- Titles should feel like real streaming-era songs: clear, memorable, natural English.

TITLE RULES (COMMERCIAL-FIRST)
- 1–5 words; avoid punctuation except apostrophes.
- Strongly avoid any word in BannedTitleRoots or obvious morphs (plurals, hyphenations, compounds).
- Do NOT repeat any stem already present in TitleHistory.
- Lean "everyday" diction (e.g., "Back to You", "Keep Me Close", "On My Mind") but make it original.
- If the drafted title violates bans/history, silently regenerate the TITLE ONLY until it passes.

PARAMETERS BLOCK (PRODUCER-READY, CONCISE)
- Genre: <main + subgenre>
- BPM: <integer; match genre>
- Key/Mode: <e.g., A minor, D mixolydian> (recommended)
- Time Signature: <usually 4/4; allow 3/4 or 6/8 if apt>
- Lead Vocal: <e.g., Female alto / Male baritone / Nonbinary tenor; rap/sung/mixed; belt/head/falsetto>
- Backing Vocals: <e.g., stacked harmonies, ad-libs, call-and-response, gang>
- Energy: <low/medium/high + short descriptor like "high — radio lift">
- Instrumentation: <4–8 items; genre-faithful>
- Production Notes: <2–4 short bullets like "808 slides", "sidechain pads", "tape slap", "guitar octaves">
- Hook Twist: <distinctive moment: key change in bridge, halftime drop, beat switch, chant, crowd claps, modal shift>
- (If Hip-Hop) Rhyme Scheme: <e.g., AABB with internal multis; 16-bar verses; cadences noted>
- (If R&B/Pop) Vocal Techniques: <e.g., light melisma, stacked 3rds on chorus, tasteful falsetto>

LYRIC STRUCTURE (KEEP IT COMMERCIAL)
- EXACT section headers and order; each section present ONCE.
- Line counts: Intro 2–4; Verse 1 and Verse 2 4–8 each; Pre-Chorus 2–4; Chorus 4–6 with a repeatable hook (repeat core phrase 2–3x); Bridge 2–6; Outro 2–4.
- Keep language concrete and conversational. Use modern vernacular. Avoid "weird-aesthetic" lexicon (glow/circuit/galaxy/etc.) unless StyleMode="experimental".
- R&B (love/heartbreak): intimate imagery, tactile details (hands, late texts, kitchen light, backseat rain-on-window is OK but don't overuse weather/night clichés).
- Hip-Hop: wordplay, internal rhymes, punchlines; keep ContentRating; if Drill/Trap, note cadence & ad-libs; avoid brand name-dropping unless asked.
- EDM/Pop/House: build to a chantable hook; clear pre-chorus lift; lyrics suit crowd singalong; if "festival", bigger imagery is allowed (still mainstream).
- Afrobeats/Amapiano: buoyant, percussive phrasing; light code-switching fine; feel-good romance/party.
- Rock/Pop-Punk: kinetic verbs, band-in-a-room feel; punchy chorus.
- Reggaeton/Latin Pop: dembow-friendly phrasing; Spanglish ok; flirtatious but clean.
- Country/Indie-Folk: narrative detail, place names, simple but vivid pictures.

GENRE GUARDRAILS (TEMPO/FEEL)
- R&B: 70–95 BPM; smooth chords; tasteful falsetto allowed.
- Hip-Hop: 80–100 or 140–160 (double-time); 808s/hats; flow-specific notes.
- EDM: House 120–128; Techno 125–135; Trance 130–140; Dubstep 140; DnB 170–176.
- Afrobeats 100–116; Amapiano 110–119 (log drums).
- Pop 95–125; bright/modern, major/mixolydian common.
- Rock 90–160; alt/indie/pop-punk/classic variants.
- Reggaeton 90–105; dembow rhythm.
- Country 70–110; storytelling; acoustic/electric blend.
- Indie/Folk 70–110; acoustic textures.
