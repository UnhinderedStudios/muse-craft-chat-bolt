––––– RULES (MEMORYLESS VARIETY EACH ROLL) –––––
- Pick all choices fresh each roll (no assumptions about previous output).
- GENRE: uniformly sample one main genre from {POP,RNB,HIPH,ROCK,AFRO,AMAP,REGG,CNTR,INDI,FOLK,LPOP,HOUS,TECH,TRNC,DUBS,DNB,TRAP,DRIL,BMBP,ALTR,PPNK}.
- LEAD VOCAL (avoid defaulting to female): sample from {MALE,FEM,NBIN,DUET,RAPR} with weights {0.30,0.15,0.20,0.15,0.20}. If you initially pick FEM, re-roll once with the same weights and use the second result.
- POV: sample uniformly from {1ST,2ND,3RD}. Prefer 2ND when unsure (addresses "you").
- KEY: 50% major (e.g., C, G, D, A, E, F, Bb), 50% minor/mode (e.g., Am, Em, F#m, Dm, Bm).
- BPM: choose an integer in the valid range for the chosen genre (see TEMPO GUIDE) and encode as 3 digits + "b" (e.g., 092b, 124b, 174b).
- ENERGY: uniformly {LOW,MED,HIGH}.
- LANGUAGE: English. Keep it clean (radio-ready).
- Avoid "aesthetic/tech" words by default (ban in titles: NEON, TANGERINE, CIRCUIT, STARLIT, COSMIC, GALAXY, MIDNIGHT, WHISPER, RAIN, ECHO, SHADOW, TONIGHT, HEARTBEAT, LONELY, FOREVER).

LYRIC STYLE (MAINSTREAM):
- Conversational, relatable, genre-appropriate (R&B love, rap confidence, EDM anthems, Afrobeats vibes, rock hooks, country storytelling, etc.).
- Pronouns must match POV: if POV=2ND, address "you"; if 1ST, use "I/we"; if 3RD, use a name or "they".
- Keep sections once each, in the exact order.
